1 [Linear regression on a polynomial

The files q1xTrain.npy, q1xTest.npy, q1yTrain.npy and q1yTest.npy specify a linear regression problem for a polynomial. q1xTrain.npy represent the inputs (x(i) ∈ R) and q1yTrain.npy represents the outputs (y(i) ∈ R) of the training set, with one training example per row.

(a)&nbsp; You will compare the following two optimization methods, in finding the coefficients of a polynomial of degree one (i.e. slope and intercept) that minimize the training loss.

• Batch gradient descent

• Stochastic gradient descent

i.&nbsp; Give the coefficients generated by each of the optimization methods. Report the hy- perparameters used to generate the coefficients.

ii.&nbsp; We compare two optimization methods in terms of the number of epochs required for convergence. We define an “epoch” as one pass through the entire training samples. Compare the number of epochs to converge for the methods. Which method converges faster? Report the hyperparameters used for comparison. [Hint: in this question, the training process can be viewed as convergent when the mean squared error EMS = N1 􏰅Ni=1(w0 + w1x(i) − y(i))2 on the training dataset is consistently small enough (e.g. ≤ 0.2).]

(b)&nbsp; Next, you will investigate the problem of over-fitting. Recall the figure from lecture that explored over-fitting as a function of the degree of the polynomial M, where the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) Error is defined as

i. Regenerate the above chart with the provided data. To find the parameters, use the closed form solution of linear regression (assuming all the condition is met) that minimize the error for a M -degree polynomial (for M = 0 . . . 9) for the training data in q1xTrain.npy and q1yTrain.npy. For the test curve, use the data in q1xTest.npy and q1yTest.npy. [Note: For different values of M, we assume the feature vector is φ(x(i)) = (1, x(i), (x(i))2, · · · , (x(i))M ). The trend of your curve is not necessarily the same as the sample plot.]

ii.&nbsp; Which degree polynomial would you say best fits the data? Was there evidence of under/over-fitting the data? Use your generated charts to justify your answer.

(c)&nbsp; Finally, you will explore the role of regularization. Recall the image from lecture that explored the effect of the regularization factor λ:

i. Derive the closed form solution of the ridge regression, find the coefficients that minimize the error for a ninth degree polynomial (M = 9) given regularization factor λ (for λ ∈ {0, 10−8, 10−7, 10−6, 10−5, . . . , 10−1, 100(= 1)}) for the training data specified in q1xTrain.npy and q1yTrain.npy. Now use these parameters to plot the ERMS of both the training data and test data as a function of λ and regenerate the above chart, using q1xTest.npy and q1yTest.npy as the test data). Specifically, use the following regularized objective function:

2 [36 points] Locally weighted linear regression

Consider a linear regression problem in which we want to weight different training examples differently. Specifically, suppose we want to minimize

1 􏰀N

ED(w) = 2

where r(i) is the weight for the sample (x(i), y(i)). In class, we worked out what happens for the case where all the weights (the r(i)’s) are the same. In this problem, we will generalize some of those ideas to the weighted setting, and also implement the locally weighted linear regression algorithm. [Note: the weight r(i) can be different for each of the training example.]

(a) [2 points] Show that ED(w) can also be written as

ED(w) = (Xw − y)T R(Xw − y)

for an appropriate diagonal matrix R, and where X is a matrix whose i-th row is x(i) and y is the vector whose i-th entry is y(i). State clearly what R is.

(b) [8 points] If all the r(i)’s equal 1, then we saw in class that the normal equation is XT Xw = XT y,

and that the value of w∗ that minimizes ED(w) is given by (XT X)−1XT y. By finding the derivative ∇wED(w) and setting that to zero, generalize the normal equation and the closed form solution to this weighted setting, and give the new value of w∗ that minimizes ED(w) in closed form as a function of X, R and y.

(c) [8 points] Suppose we have a training set {(x(i),y(i));i = 1…,N} of N independent examples, but in which the y(i)’s were observed with differing variances. Specifically, suppose that

(i) (i) 1 􏰃 (y(i)−wTx(i))2􏰄 p(y |x ; w) = √2πσ(i) exp − 2(σ(i))2

I.e., y(i) has mean wT x(i) and variance (σ(i))2 (where the σ(i)’s are fixed, known, constants). Show that finding the maximum likelihood estimate of w reduces to solving a weighted linear regression problem. State clearly what the r(i)’s are in terms of the σ(i)’s.

(b) [14 points] Consider the definition and property of positive (semi-)definite matrix. Let A be a real, symmetric d × d matrix. A is positive semi-definite (PSD) if, for all z ∈ Rd, zT Az ≥ 0. A is positive definite(PD)if,forallz̸=0,zTAz&gt;0. WewriteA⪰0whenAisPSD,andA≻0when A is PD. The spectral theorem says that every real symmetric matrix A can be expressed via the spectral decomposition A = UΛUT where U is a d × d matrix such that UUT = UT U = I and Λ = diag(λ1,λ2,··· ,λd). Multiplying on the right by U we see that AU = UΛ. If we let ui denote the i-th column of U, we have Aui = λiui for each i. Then λi are eigenvalues of A, and the corresponding columns are eigenvectors associated to λi. The eigenvalues constitute the “spectrum” of A, and the spectral decomposition is also called the eigenvalue decomposition of A.

<li>[8 points] Consider the linear regression problem where Φ and y are as defined in class and the closed form solution is (ΦT Φ)−1ΦT y. We can get the eigenvalues of symmetric matrix ΦT Φ using spectral decomposition. We apply ridge regression, and the symmetric matrix in the solution is ΦT Φ + βI. Prove that the ridge regression has an effect of shifting all singular values by a constant β. For any β &gt; 0, ridge regression makes the matrix ΦT Φ + βI PD.</li>
